## The C Chord

There are only four strings so it is much easier to learn comparing to guitar. For example you only have to press the third fret on the first string to play the C major chord.

## Bar chord
The numbers in the circle are fingering suggestings. 1 is for the index finger, 2 is for the middle finger, etc. So for chord Fm7, I'm not suggesting you have 3 index finger but press the whole finger on the first fret to form a bar.
